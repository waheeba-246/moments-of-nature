    <H1 id="about">ABOUT ME</H1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Waheeba, a passionate photographer who loves turning everyday moments into timeless memories. My style
        blends creativity with authenticity, whether it’s landscapes, portraits, or candid shots. Through my lens, I aim
        to capture the emotion behind every moment.Photography is like capturing a moment, freezing time, and telling a
        story without words 🌠. It's about light, composition, and the emotions you convey through your lens. Whether
        it's a sunset, a portrait, or a street scene, photography lets you capture the world's beauty and share your
        unique perspective. What do you love about photography? 😊</p>
